Excellent.
We will build this like an engineered system — not a creative exercise.

Below is a **clear, execution-ready, step-by-step process** to build the Sitelytc Revenue Architecture website properly.

No skipping.

---

# PHASE 0 — STRATEGIC FOUNDATION (Before Design)

## Step 1 — Lock Positioning (Non-Negotiable) {Done}

Write this internally and commit to it:

**Sitelytc Digital Media**
Precision Digital Architecture for Scaling Businesses.

Core Offer:
**Revenue Architecture Program (RAP-90)**
₹12L–₹28L

If you don’t anchor the entire website to one flagship offer, the site becomes generic.

---

## Step 2 — Define Primary Conversion Goal {Done}

Only ONE primary CTA across the entire website:

> Book Strategic Diagnostic

Everything must push toward this.

No:

* “Get Quote”
* “Let’s Chat”
* “Contact Us”

Authority language only.

---

## Step 3 — Choose Platform {Done}

Recommended stack:

* **Framer** → Fast, modern, conversion-focused
* **Webflow** → More control
* **Next.js + Tailwind** → If building fully custom

For speed + positioning: Framer or Webflow.

---

# PHASE 1 — INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE

Now we structure pages.

---

## Step 4 — Create Sitemap {Done}

Final Sitemap:

1. Home
2. Revenue Architecture Program (RAP-90)
3. Case Results
4. Industries
5. About
6. Book Diagnostic

No blog initially.
No service clutter.

---

## Step 5 — Define Page Roles {Done}

Home = Authority Filter
RAP-90 = Offer Deep Dive
Case Results = Proof Engine
Industries = Relevance Amplifier
About = Credibility
Book Diagnostic = Conversion Gate

Every page has one job.

---

# PHASE 2 — WIREFRAME BUILD (Structure Before Design)

Do NOT design yet.

---

## Step 6 — Wireframe Homepage (Low Fidelity) {Done}

Draw this structure first.

### Section 1 — Hero

Headline:
We Engineer Revenue Infrastructure for Scaling Businesses.

Subheadline:
Not websites. Structured digital systems that unlock scalable growth.

Primary CTA: Book Strategic Diagnostic
Secondary CTA: View Framework

---

### Section 2 — The Scaling Ceiling

Short structured bullets:

* Revenue plateau
* Rising acquisition costs
* Backend inefficiencies
* Fragmented data

Goal: Pain validation.

---

### Section 3 — Revenue Leak Diagram

Visual funnel:

Traffic → UX → Checkout → CRM → Ops → Reporting

Highlight friction points.

---

### Section 4 — RAP-90 Framework

3 equal blocks:

Phase 1 – Diagnostic
Phase 2 – Infrastructure
Phase 3 – Optimization

Clean, diagrammatic.

---

### Section 5 — Metrics Section

Metric Cards:

+38% Conversion Lift
+22% AOV
-40 Hours/Month Ops Saved
+X% Revenue Growth

Numbers only.

---

### Section 6 — Who This Is For / Not For

For:
Scaling companies ₹4Cr+

Not For:
Early-stage startups
One-off redesign projects

Authority filter.

---

### Section 7 — Final CTA

Strong contrast section:

Ready to Remove Revenue Bottlenecks?

[ Book Strategic Diagnostic ]

---

Stop here.

Do NOT add testimonials.
Do NOT add team photos.
Do NOT add service grids.

---

# PHASE 3 — VISUAL SYSTEM DESIGN

Now we design.

---

## Step 7 — Define Design System {Done}

Color Palette:

Primary: Deep Navy (#0B1C2D style)
Secondary: White
Accent: Muted gold or steel grey

Avoid:

* Neon colors
* Startup gradients
* Playful icons

---

## Step 8 — Typography {Done}

Headline:
Bold geometric sans serif

Body:
Inter / clean modern sans

Use strong numeric emphasis:
Large font size for metrics.

---

## Step 9 — Visual Language Rules {Done}

Use:

* Clean grid
* Data cards
* Diagrams
* Thin line icons
* Subtle micro-animations

Avoid:

* Stock team handshake images
* Overused abstract blobs
* Overly rounded playful UI

---

# PHASE 4 — BUILD RAP-90 PAGE

This is your close page.

---

## Step 10 — RAP-90 Page Structure {Done}

Hero:
Revenue Architecture Program (RAP-90)

Section 1:
The Revenue Bottleneck Explained

Section 2:
Phase 1 – Strategic Diagnostic

Section 3:
Phase 2 – Infrastructure Rebuild

Section 4:
Phase 3 – Optimization Layer

Section 5:
Financial Impact Model (Math example)

Section 6:
Investment Range (₹12L–₹28L)

Section 7:
FAQ (handle objections)

Section 8:
Book Diagnostic CTA

---

# PHASE 5 — CASE RESULTS PAGE

---

## Step 11 — Structure Case Page {Done}

For each case:

Company Type
Problem
Infrastructure Fix
Quantified Result

Example Layout:

Before:
Conversion 1.8%

After:
Conversion 2.6%

Revenue Impact:
+₹X annually

Clean. Measurable.

---

# PHASE 6 — DIAGNOSTIC PAGE (Conversion Engine)

---

## Step 12 — Create High-Barrier Form {Done}

Fields:

* Company Name
* Industry
* Annual Revenue
* Monthly Traffic
* Biggest Bottleneck
* Current Tech Stack
* Budget Range

This does 3 things:

1. Filters unserious leads
2. Signals premium
3. Pre-qualifies for sales call

---

# PHASE 7 — CONVERSION OPTIMIZATION

---

## Step 13 — Add Authority Enhancers

* Security badges (subtle)
* NDA-friendly language
* Performance data blocks
* Case metric graphs

---

## Step 14 — Remove Friction {Done}

* Sticky header CTA
* Minimal navigation
* No clutter
* No unnecessary animations

---

# PHASE 8 — PRE-LAUNCH CHECK

---

## Step 15 — Run 5-Second Test

Ask:
“What does this company do?”

If answer is:
“They build websites.”

You failed.

If answer is:
“They engineer revenue systems.”

You succeeded.

---

# PHASE 9 — POST-LAUNCH

---

## Step 16 — Drive Traffic

* LinkedIn outbound
* Cold email
* Founder content
* Case study breakdown posts

The site is the authority anchor.

Outbound drives volume.

---

# Critical Rule

Your website must feel:

Structured
Disciplined
Enterprise-ready
Financially intelligent

Not creative.
Not artistic.
Not “agency-ish.”

---
